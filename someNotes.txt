The core data structure to use here is Trie.
aka Prefix Tree
Each node in trie represents a character of word.
WHY ? -> it allows to find all words starting with specific prefix in o(L)time.
where L is length of prefix, each node stores frequency to help rank.

in search engine we want most popular words
so we do frequency based ranking
instead of storing characters, each node in trie can maintain list of top K most freq items that pass through that node
